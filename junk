                    <h2>Heuristic visualization — an imaginative grasp of tensorial structure</h2>
                    A tensor can be thought of as a structured mapping between geometric directions and physical magnitudes — a mathematical object that encodes how a quantity responds to changes in spatial orientation.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In three dimensions, each component <b>T<sub>ijk</sub></b> represents the interaction between three coordinate directions (<i>x, y, z</i>).  
                    Depending on the combination of indices, we can interpret the physical meaning as follows:
                    <ul style={{listStylePosition:"inside", textAlign:"left"}}>
                        <li>
                        <b>i = j = k</b>: fully aligned components — they describe direct effects along a single axis (e.g. <b>T<sub>xxx</sub>, T<sub>yyy</sub>, T<sub>zzz</sub></b>), representing pure “normal” behavior.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        <b>i = j ≠ k</b>: plane-related terms — components like <b>T<sub>xxz</sub></b> or <b>T<sub>yyx</sub></b> show how phenomena extend or project within a plane but vary slightly across the third axis.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        <b>i ≠ j ≠ k</b>: fully mixed components — these reflect coupling between all three axes, where a change in one direction influences behavior along another (e.g. <b>T<sub>xyz</sub></b>).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Together, these components form a complete spatial map of how geometry and physical quantities interact — 
                    providing both an analytical and intuitive view of multidimensional relationships within a system.
