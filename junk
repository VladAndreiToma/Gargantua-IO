          <label><b>Gargantua</b> is an interactive simulation platform designed to visualize and explore the physics of black holes</label>
          <label>From gravitational lensing and accretion disks to black hole mergers and space time curvature - every frame is powered by real physical models and webgl rendering</label>
          <label>It is built for scientist, students and dreamers who want to experience the universe through light and gravity</label>
